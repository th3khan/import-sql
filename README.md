# How to Efficiently Import a .sql Database in MySQL

## Introduction

This repository contains a custom script that addresses the issue of efficiently importing .sql databases in MySQL. In this documentation file, you'll learn how to use the script and how to resolve common issues related to importing databases in phpMyAdmin.

## The Problem

Importing a .sql database in MySQL can be challenging, especially when dealing with large files. Developers often encounter performance issues or even complete blockages during the import process.

## The Solution

This repository provides an effective solution for the problem of importing .sql databases in MySQL. The custom script included in this repository:

- Optimizes PHP configuration to handle large database files.
- Provides real-time tracking of the import process.
- Offers specific messages for different import operations.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Download the Script

Begin by downloading the script to your local machine.

### 2. Deploy the Script on Your Apache Server

Upload the script to your Apache web server. You can place it in the desired directory where you want to execute the import process. For example, you can upload it to your server's root directory.

### 3. Access the Script in Your Web Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to the script's URL by entering it in the address bar. The URL format should be something like: `http://yourdomain.com/import-sql.php`

### 4. Configure Database Connection Details

Once you access the script through your web browser, a form will be displayed, allowing you to enter your database connection details:

- Database Name
- Username
- Password
- File Upload: You can either upload the .sql file directly from your computer or, if you've previously uploaded the file to the same directory as the script, you can enter the file name without the .sql extension. For example, if your file is named 'database_backup.sql', you can simply enter 'database_backup'.

### 5. Click "Generate"

After filling in the necessary database connection details and selecting the file, click the "Generate" button to start the import process.

### 6. Complete the Import

The script will handle the import process efficiently, providing real-time updates and progress tracking. Once the import is complete, you'll receive a success message.
